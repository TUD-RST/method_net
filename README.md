## Development

- uses NPM for management of Javascript libraries
- Webpack builds bundle that is finally served as `/static/ackbas_core/main.js`
- Run `npm run build` after changing `ackbas_core/js/index.js`
- Alternatively, run `npm run watch` to start Webpack in watch mode. The typescript source will then automatically be recompiled when it changes.
