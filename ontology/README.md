# General Information

This directory contains experiments how to represent the knowledge from (or behind) the method network in an ontological way.

The representation is based on <https://github.com/cknoll/yamlpyowl> which itself is experimental and will probably evolve without maintaining (full) backward compatibility for a while.

Additionally, there will be an mixture of German and English language throughout the project. While this is aesthetically challenging it reduces friction of translation issues â€“ which is helpful in an early conceptual phase.
